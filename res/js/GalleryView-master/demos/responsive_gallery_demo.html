<title>GalleryView - Default Demo</title>

<!-- First, add jQuery (and jQuery UI if using custom easing or animation -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.18/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>

<!-- Second, add the Timer and Easing plugins -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.timers-1.2.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.easing.1.3.js"></script>

<!-- Third, add the GalleryView Javascript and CSS files -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/jquery.galleryview-3.0-dev.js"></script>
<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="../css/jquery.galleryview-3.0-dev.css" />

<!-- Lastly, call the galleryView() function on your unordered list(s) -->
<script type="text/javascript">
	$(function(){
    
    var $gallery = $('#myGallery');//save the ul in a variable
    
		$gallery.galleryView();// init the gallery (as usual)
		
		
		//
		// This is a demo of a responsive GalleryView.
		//
		// I extended the exellent GalleryView-plugin 
		// to support resizing of the gallery.
		//
		// You can now call 
		//   .resizeGalleryView(new_panel_width, new_panel_height, new_frame_width, new_frame_height); 
		// on the gallery to resize the gallery.
		//
		// In this demo the gallery is resized to fit the full page.
		//
		// Have fun with it!
		//
		// - Jeroen Penninck

		//
		// resize function, gets called when the browser resizes
		//
		
		function resizeTheGallery(){
        //
        // Implement your own way of resizing here!
        //
        // This implementation resizes the gallery to fit the div with id "#galleryContainer"
        //
        
        var totalhorizontalmargin = 10;//see settings of gallery
        var totalverticalmargin = 15;//see settings of gallery
        

        // the new width of the thumbs
        var new_frame_width = $("#galleryContainer").width()/900*150;//just some random factor...
        var new_frame_height = $("#galleryContainer").width()/900*80;
        
        // the new width of the panel
        var new_panel_width = $("#galleryContainer").width()-totalhorizontalmargin;
        var new_panel_height = $("#galleryContainer").height()-new_frame_height-totalverticalmargin;//note: the filmstrip is below the gallery so we have to subtract the height of a frame

        // call the new resize method :)
        $gallery.resizeGalleryView(new_panel_width, new_panel_height, new_frame_width, new_frame_height);
		}
		
		
		//call the resize method and bind to resize event
    $(window).resize(resizeTheGallery);
    resizeTheGallery();

I almost went back inside when something on this huge palm tree leaf caught my eye. I stayed around and it was this little gecko, startled by my presence he was hidden between the ridges of the leaf. He would pop his head up periodically to check his surroundings, as soon as he saw i was still there he would hide again. We played this game for a while until i got the shot.

These geckos were living all around the hale' we were staying in, enjoying the noni and basking on the railing and sunny steps to our place. They were very shy mostly, except this one must have enjoyed the nectar so much as to let me get a shot of their favorite activity. They seemed to tend the noni very attentively throughout the day.
